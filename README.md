In this program, a variety of data structures and algorithms are used for efficient library management. Here is a brief description of them:

Data Structures:

1. Hash Table (Closed Hashing with Quadratic Probing): This data structure provides fast access and retrieval of information about readers based on ticket numbers. It allows for storing and quickly finding related data.

2. Circular Singly Linked List: This list is used to track information about book loans and readers. It forms a closed structure, simplifying the management of loan data.

3. AVL Tree: The AVL tree is used to store information about books in the library. It provides a balanced data structure, improving the performance of search, insertion, and deletion operations.

Algorithms:

1. Boyer-Moore Algorithm: It is used for efficient searching of books by author or title in the text. This algorithm enables quick finding of substring matches.

2. Cocktail Shaker Sort: It is employed for data sorting. In this program, it is used for sorting reader data, creating an ordered list.

3. Inorder Traversal of AVL Tree: This traversal allows for visiting elements in the AVL tree in symmetric (or infix) order. It is useful for outputting data in an ordered form.

Together, these data structures and algorithms provide the functionality for efficient library management, including reader and book records, loan operations, and searching and sorting of data.
